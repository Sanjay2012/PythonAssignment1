Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division

***Features:***

Handles ValueError if the input is not a valid integer
Handles ZeroDivisionError if division by zero is attempted
Handles any other unexpected errors

***Description:***
This program prompts the user to enter an integer and checks if it is even or odd using an if-else statement.

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop (task2_sum1_to_50.py)
***Description:***
This program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop and displays the result.

### Assignment 3
### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function (task1-Factorial.py)
***Description:***
