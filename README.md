# Python Input and Error Handling Examples

This repository contains two simple Python programs demonstrating the use of input handling, validation, and exception management.

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks Covered

### Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations with Error Handling

This script takes two integer inputs from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

**Features:**
- Handles `ValueError` if the input is not a valid integer
- Handles `ZeroDivisionError` if division by zero is attempted
- Handles any other unexpected errors

  
### Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
This script collects a user's first and last name with input validation, then displays a personalized greeting.

**Validation Rules:**
- Name fields cannot be empty
- Names must only contain alphabetic characters (spaces allowed between multiple names)

### ðŸ›  Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required.

### ðŸš€ How to Run
- Clone the repository 
- Run the script using:
- python filename.py
